# Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy By David Burns

---

### What is a cognition?

- A cognition is a thought or perception

### What are the three principles of cognitive therapy?

1. All your moods are created by your "cognition" or thoughts. Your cognition refers to the way you look at things and interpret them.
2. When feeling depressed your thoughts are dominated by pervasive negativity.
3. Negative thoughts that cause turmoil nearly always contain _gross distortions_.

- **Gross Distortion**: Unhelpful thinking styles or biased thoughts.

### Diagnosing your moods: First Step

- Use BDC to detech the presence of depression and its severity. [Burns Depression Checklist](https://www.uwgb.edu/UWGBCMS/media/Continueing-Professional-Education/files/Assess-Pkt-1-Burns-Depression-Checklist.pdf)

### Understanding your moods

- The relationship between the world and the way you feel

  - _World_: A series of positive, neutral, or negative events
  - _Thoughts_: Interpret the events with a series of thoughts "internal dialogue"
  - _Mood_: Feelings created by thoughts, all events processed by the brain and given a conscious meaning.

- Identifying the types of cognitive distortions
  1. **All-or-nothing**: Seeing things in black or white, causes you to fear any mistake or imperfection because you will then see yourself as a loser, and will cause you to feel inadequate and worthless. You over evaluate your personal qualities in extreme categories.
  2. **Overgeneralization**: If something happened to you once it will occur over and over again. Someone experiencing rejection and immediately thinking that they are not going to try the activity in which they got rejected again is an example of overgeneralizing. A real world example would be: A young man asked a girl out for a date and she politely declines, the young man then begins to think that he will never get a date and no one would want to date him and that hell be lonely forever.
  3. **Mental filter**: You pick one single negative detail and dwell on it exclusively thus perceiving that whole situation as negative.For example, a student is taking a test and they felt as if they have missed 17/100, they dwelled on those missed questions and concluded that they would flunk out of college.
  4. **Disqualifying the positive**: You reject a positive experience by insisting they dont count for some reason or other. In this way you can maintain a negative belief that is contradicted by your everyday experiences. "An everyday example of this would be the way most of us have been conditioned to respond to compliments. When someone praises your apperance or your work, you might automatically tell yourself, 'They are just being nice'". You tell yourself that any positive experience was a fluke.
  5. **Jumping to conslusions**: You make a negative interpretation even though theres no definite facts that convicingly support your conclusion. Two examples of this are mind reading and fortune teller error.
     1. **Mind Reading**: You assume that people are looking down on you, and youre so convinced about that, that you dont even bother to check it out.
     2. **Fortune Teller**: You imagine something bad is about to happen, and you take this prediction as fact even though it is unrealistic
  6. **Magnification and Minification**: You exaggerate the importance of things(asuch as your goof ups or someone elses achievements), or you inappropiately shrink things until they appear tiny(on your own desirable qualities or the other persons imperfections).
  7. **Emotional Reasoning**: You assume that your negative emotions necessarily reflect the way things really are: "I feel it, therefore it must be true." An unusual side effect of emotional reasoning is **procrastionation**. You often avoid things because you feel negative emotions to that task.
  8. **Should Statements**: You try to motivate yourself with shoulds and shouldn'ts, as if you had to be whipped and punished before you could be expected to do anything. Must and oughts are also offenders. The emotional consequence of this is guilt. You can often aim should statements at others and feel frustrated and self righteous when your expectations werent met. When the reality of your own behavior falls short of your standars, you shouldnt create shame, guilt, and self loathing.
  9. **Labeling and Mislabeling**: An extreme form of overgeneralization. Instead of descring your error, you attach a negative label to yourself: "Im a failure." When someones behavior rubs you the wrong way, you attach a negative label to them. Mislabeling is when you describe an event with language that is highly colored and emotionally loaded.
  10. **Personalization**: You assume responsibility for a negative event where there is not basis for doing so. You arbitrarily conclude that what happened was your fault or reflects your inadequacy, even if you were not responsible for it. Crippling Guilt.

### Practical Applications

- Depressed pateints see themselves as defecient in the very qualities they value the most. Such as: intellegence, achievement,popularity,attractiveness, and strength.

  1. Defeat
  2. Defection
  3. Desertion
  4. Deprivation

**How to Boost Self-Esteem**

1. Talk back to internal critic

   1. Train yourself to recoginize and write down self critical thoughts. Look out for statements such as "Im no good", "Im shit", "Im inferior", and so on.
   2. Learn why these thoughts are distorted (identify cognitive distortion)
   3. Practice talking back to them so as to develop a more realistic self-evaluation system.

- **User Triple column technique**
- The Triple column technique [example](https://pro.psychcentral.com/psychoeducation/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/1-2-1024x254.jpg)

  - When having a negative thought, ask yourself, " What thoughts are going through my mind right now? What am i saying to myself? Why is this upsetting me? and formulate a rational response.
  - When someones behavior rubs you the wrong way, you attach aa ne e going through my mind right now? What am i saying to myself? Why is this upsetting me? and formulate a rational response.\* In the Automatic thought column dont use words to describe your emotional reactions just write down the thoughts that created the emotion. Don’t write “I feel crappy” because you can’t disprove that with a rational response. The fact is, you do feel crappy. Instead, write down the thoughts that automatically flashed through your mind the moment you saw the tire; for example, “I’m so stupid—I should have gotten a new tire this last month,” or “Oh, hell! This is just my rotten luck!” Then you can substitute rational responses such as “It might have been better to get a new tire, but I’m not stupid and no one can predict the future with certainty.” This process won’t put air in the tire, but at least you won’t have to change it with a deflated ego.

2. Use Mental Biofeedback

- Monitor negative thoughts with a wrist counter, click the button each time a negative though crosses your mind. then log the count at the end of the day
